Dear instructors﻿, I hope this message finds you both at good health in these dire times of toilet paper shortage.

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿The following code includes the functions Tree-Delete and transplant even though they were not needed to complete the lab.

We have also prepared the test that João asked for (predecessor and successor on no. 72 that can be found in﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ the file test-10-1-problem)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿.

All you have to do is run the code (after changing the paths starting at line 7 in the file main.c).

Testing a colleague:
We tested the code of Gunnar Sutter in which all of our tests succeeded.
The tests included all of the dynamic set operations, including testing with the load file function.

We hope the code is to your satisfaction.

Best,

Eduardo & Junior
