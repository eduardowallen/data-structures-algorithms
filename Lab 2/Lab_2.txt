If all elements are the same or if the array is sorted in ascending order, Insertion Sort works best. As no number are larger or smaller, and that the array is already sorted in correct order "ascending" there will be no switches. The algoritm will just work O(n) time in both cases.In rest of the cases Merge Sort works best. Merge Sort takes a bit more memory than Quick Sort, but are more stable. Time-wise they are almost the same with O(n log n) in average and best case, however they differ in worst case time with Merge Sort is still O(n log n) and Quick Sort O(n^2). That's why we've choosen to go with Merge Sort, as it's more stable.
